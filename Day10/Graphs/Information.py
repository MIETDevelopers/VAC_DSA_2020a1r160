#Graph is a non linear data structure where it contains nodes or vertices connected theough edges or arcs
#Where set of nodes & set of edges combine to used as represent graphs.
#Types: Finite, Infinite: Ref: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/graph-types-and-applications/
#Complete Graph n Vetices & n-1 Nodes, one vertex attached to another. --- Full Graph
#Regular graph: All number of vertices == Degree
#Representation: Adjacant matrix & Adjacent List.
#Adjacant matrix is a 2D Array which size v*v.
#In case of directed graphs if there is edge between vI to vJ, we assign Graph of IJ as 1.
#In case of undirected graphts we have to show there is a edge from i to j & Vice Versa.
